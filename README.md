# SemicONTO

SemicONTO (***Semic***onductor ***ONTO***logy) is an ontology for the semiconductor domain. 

### Use Case:
SemicONTO aims to capture semantics that can represent: (1) composition information of semiconductors in terms of of basic chemical composition information as well as structural information (e.g., donors); (2) property information of semiconductors. 

### Competency Questions:

#### What are the different kinds of semiconductors?
#### What are the conditions for a semiconductor experiment?
#### What are the donor materials in a semiconductor?
#### What are the values of particular semiconductor properties?
